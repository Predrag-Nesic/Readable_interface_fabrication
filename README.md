# Readable_interface_fabrication
This is a simple assignment that was given to me to solve during the initial phase of learning period.
The goal was to make the fabrication of three kinds of objects: an SMS, an empty eBook, and an eBook with pages.
The objects can be made individualy one by one by hand, or using a fabrication by generating a random number.
All objects are written using an interface named "Readable" by method "read()", which is overriden in each class.
I hope you like this humble assignment.
